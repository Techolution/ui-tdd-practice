### The Holy Process of TDD
1. Write a failing test first - RED
2. Write the source code until the test passes - GREEN
3. Refactor the code to make it better and more efficient ( ensuring the test remains GREEN )

Fail, Pass, Refactor!

Fail, Pass, Refactor!

Red, Green, Refactor!

Red, Green, Refactor!

This is your mantra!
